# Appropriate Text-Background Contrast Check

## Description

The "Appropriate Text-Background Contrast Check" evaluates whether text maintains sufficient contrast against its background to ensure optimal readability.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> color combinations for which the contrast ratio meets or exceeds the minimum contrast ratio allowed by the WCAG, which is 3 to 1 for larger font text and 4.5 to 1 for regular font text.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** High contrast ensures text remains legible for users with low vision or visual impairments.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Clear distinction between text and background reduces the effort required to read, preventing cognitive overload.
- **Color Blindness:** Standardized contrast ratios ensure that users who cannot distinguish specific hues can still rely on luminance to read content.
- **Elderly:** Maintaining high contrast supports users with natural vision degradation, ensuring long-term accessibility.
