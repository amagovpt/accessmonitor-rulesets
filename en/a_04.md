# Missing Site Searches, Indexes, and Site Maps Check

## Description

The "Missing Site Searches, Indexes, and Site Maps Check" evaluates whether a web page contains at least one link element (i.e., <code>&lt;a href="..."&gt;</code>).

## Example outcome

I found that this page <mark>has no</mark> links.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Visually impaired users often bring up a list of links using their assistive tech to scan and jump through the page. No links means no way to do that.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users using keyboard-only navigation or switch devices need clear, focusable links to navigate.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities may rely on consistent and visible links to understand how to move around. A lack of links can create confusion and cognitive overload.
- **Learning Disabilities:** Links often give context or provide alternatives for finding more information. Without them, users with learning disabilities can get stuck.

## Fixes

To address missing page links:

1. Create a link element.
2. Ensure it contains descriptive text (e.g., <code>&lt;a href="/home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code>). 
3. Ensure that the link works properly by providing the correct path.
