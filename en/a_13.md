# Inadequate Identical Links - Equal Destination Check

## Description

The "Inadequate Identical Links - Equal Destination Check" evaluates whether there are groups of links that share the same accessible name and contextual surroundings, but lead to different targets.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> group of links with the same accessible name and context but different targets.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** When navigating by links, a screen reader might just read a list of "Learn more", "Learn more", "Learn more" — with no context about what changes between them. This makes navigation guesswork and lowers confidence.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** People who depend on predictable structure may not realize they’re being sent to different places, leading to confusion or frustration. It increases memory burden — users must remember where each "Learn more" leads.

## Fixes

To address inadequate identical links:

1. Identify the links with the same accessible name but different destination.
2. Use different accessible names for links with different destinations.
