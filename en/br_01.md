# Inappropriate Structural Grouping Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Structural Grouping Check" evaluates whether there is any misuse of multiple <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements in a row, tipically used to create visual spacing or simulate structured content (like lists) rather than using proper semantic HTML elements.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> sequence composed by 3 or more <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements - I suspect they are being used to represent list items.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers interpret <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> as a pause or line break, not as a list item or section divider. As a result, list-like content rendered with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is read as a single, uninterrupted block of text, making it confusing and difficult to parse.
- **Motor Impairments:** Navigating semantically correct HTML (e.g., jumping between list items) is much easier than navigating through dozens of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags, which offer no structural context.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Visual layout tricks using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> create inconsistency between visual structure and logical meaning. Users with cognitive disabilities benefit from clear, predictable semantic grouping (like real <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> elements).

## Fixes

To address inappropriate structural grouping:

1. Locate the incorrectly used <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements.
2. Replace them with the correct semantic tags, depending on the intended meaning (e.g., <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>).
