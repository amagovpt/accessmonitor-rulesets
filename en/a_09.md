# Inadequate Identical Links Check

## Description

The "Inadequate Identical Links Check" evaluates whether there are multiple links that use the exact same text but point to different URLs.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> group of links with the same text but different targets.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers often present a list of links without their surrounding context. When links read “Learn more” or “Click here” multiple times but point to different places, the user has no idea which link goes where. This causes frustration and requires more effort to navigate or guess link purpose.
- **Motor Impairments:** Users navigating via switch devices or keyboards may need to activate and test each link individually to determine their purpose if link text isn’t clear—this adds unnecessary effort.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Ambiguous links are especially hard for users with memory or language processing disorders. They create uncertainty and reduce confidence in navigating the page.

## Fixes

To address inadequate identical links:

1. Identify the links with the same text and different destination.
2. Change one or both the texts, making them different.
