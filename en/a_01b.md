# Innapropriate Skip Navigation Links Check

## Description

The "Innapropriate Skip Navigation Links Check" evaluates whether the first link on the webpage allows users to skip directly to the main content.

## Example outcome

I found that the first link of the webpage <mark>does not allow</mark> us to skip to the main content.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users navigate linearly and may have to listen to a bunch of navigation items every time a page loads. Not having an early bypass causes unnecessary fatigue.
- **Motor Impairments:** These users often rely on keyboard-only nav. Without an early skip link, they may have to tab through multiple repetitive elements (like nav bars) just to reach the main content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Repetitive content with no way to skip can cause confusion, especially for users with memory issues or attention challenges.

## Fixes

To correct innapropriate link to main content:

1. Add a functional "skip to main content" link as the first link on the page to allow users to bypass repetitive blocks (like headers or menus) and go directly to the main content.
2. Ensure the target (<code>id</code>) matches: The link’s href should point to the main content section, and that section should have a matching id (for example, <code>&lt;div id="main-content"&gt;</code>).
3. Position the link at the very top of the page or within the header area, so it’s easily accessible without excessive tabbing.
4. Provide visible focus styles on the skip link when navigating with the keyboard, so users know where they are in the navigation process.
5. Test the link thoroughly to ensure it works across all devices and screen readers. Make sure that the "skip to content" link can be activated via keyboard navigation.
