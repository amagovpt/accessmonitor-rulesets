# Inappropriate Id Attributes Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Id Attributes Check" evaluates whether any two elements have the same <code>id</code> attribute.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> repeated <code>id</code> attribute on this webpage.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen readers may misread or skip content.
- **Motor Impairments:** Skip links or modal focus traps may not behave as expected.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Errors in structure cause confusion or misinterpretation.

## Fixes

To address inappropriately repeated <code>id</code> attributes:

1. Locate the different elements with the same <code>id</code>.
2. Change them in order to ensure that each element has a unique <code>id</code>.
