# Inappropriate Heading Hierarchy Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Heading Hierarchy Check" evaluates whether heading levels (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) follow a logical, hierarchical sequence.

## Example outcome

I found <mark>1</mark> instance in which the hierarchical sequence of heading levels is violated.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users rely on heading levels to understand content hierarchy. Skipped levels make it harder to tell what is a sub-topic vs. a new section.
- **Motor Impairments:** Keyboard navigation by heading level becomes less meaningful when heading hierarchy is inconsistent.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Logical heading flow helps users understand and mentally organize the page. Skips can cause confusion or misinterpretation.
- **Neurodivergent Disorders:** Clear, predictable structure supports users with ADHD or autism by reducing cognitive overload and frustration.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate headings hierarchy:

1. Locate all the headings that disrespect the hierarchical flow.
2. Rearrange their levels to ensure a logical sequence.
