# Skip Navigation Links Check

## Description

The "Skip Navigation Links Check" evaluates whether the first link on the webpage provides users with a clear and accessible option to skip directly to the main content of the page. 

## Example outcome

I found that the first link of the webpage <mark>allows</mark> us to skip to the main content.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Screen reader users navigate linearly and may have to listen to a bunch of navigation items every time a page loads. Not having an early bypass, or a functional one, causes unnecessary fatigue.
- **Motor Impairments:** These users often rely on keyboard-only nav. Without an early skip link, or a functional one, they may have to tab through multiple repetitive elements (like nav bars) just to reach the main content.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Repetitive content with no way to skip can cause confusion, especially for users with memory issues or attention challenges.

## Fixes

To address missing or inadequate link to main content:

1. Ensure that the first link on the page allows skipping to the main content (i.e., has a link with an appropriate skip navigation mechanism).
2. Use a skip to main content link at the top of the page that provides a direct jump to the main content (e.g., <code>&lt;a href="#main-content" class="skip-to-main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;</code>).
3. Ensure that the id of the main content section matches the target of the skip link (for example, the main content section might have an <code>id="main-content"</code>).
4. Make sure this link is visually and functionally accessible, including proper focus styles when navigating through links via keyboard.
