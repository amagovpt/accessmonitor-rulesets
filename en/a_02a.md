# Missing Skip Navigation Links Check

## Description

The "Missing Skip Navigation Links Check" evaluates the presence and functionality of skip navigation links on a webpage.

## Example outcome

<mark>I didn't find</mark> links to skip text blocks.

## Impact

- **Visual Impairments:** Users with visual impairments may rely on screen readers to navigate content. Without skip links, they will have to listen to all the navigation elements (like headers, menus, and footers) each time they load a page, which can be frustrating, time-consuming, and inefficient. They may miss key content, resulting in a poor user experience.
- **Motor Impairments:** People with limited dexterity may navigate using a keyboard. If there are no skip links, they would need to repeatedly tab through all navigation elements to get to the primary content, which can be physically exhausting and time-consuming.
- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Users with cognitive disabilities may struggle to remember or focus on navigation patterns. Skip links simplify the process by allowing them to focus directly on the core content without navigating through redundant elements.

## Fixes

To address missing link to main content:

1. Add a Skip Link to Bypass Navigation at the top of the page that allows users to skip to the main content.
2. Make sure the <code>#maincontent</code> anchor ID points to the main content section.
3. Style the Skip Link, it should be hidden by default, becoming visible when it’s focused (usually by pressing the Tab key).
4. Finally, test it to confirm it works correctly across various devices, screen readers, and browsers.
