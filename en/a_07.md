# Inappropriate Link Grouping Check

## Description

The "Inappropriate Link Grouping Check" evaluates whether navigation links are semantically grouped. Without grouping (e.g., using the `<nav>` element or ARIA landmarks), assistive technologies cannot identify these blocks as navigation units or provide ways to bypass them.

## Example outcome

I located <mark>1</mark> group of links that is not contained within a semantic grouping element (like `<nav>`) or a designated ARIA landmark. This makes it difficult for users to skip repetitive navigation content.



## Impact

* **Keyboard Navigation:** Users navigating via keyboard are forced to tab through every single link in a list before reaching the main content, which is repetitive and frustrating.
* **Screen Reader Efficiency:** Assistive technology cannot announce the beginning or end of a navigation section, making it harder for users to understand the page structure.
* **Cognitive Disabilities:** Large blocks of links that aren't visually or semantically separated can lead to confusion regarding the site's layout.
* **Structural Failure:** A lack of semantic grouping prevents search engines and other automated tools from accurately indexing the most important navigation paths of the site.

## Fixes

To address inappropriate link grouping:

1. Identify blocks of links that serve as a navigation menu (e.g., headers, sidebars, or footers).
2. Wrap these link groups in a `<nav>` element or an element with `role="navigation"`.
3. If multiple navigation blocks exist, use `aria-label` to distinguish them (e.g., `<nav aria-label="Main">`).
